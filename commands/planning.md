# /fractal:planning

## Human gates

Every time this skill needs human input (confirmation, choice, correction), use the `AskUserQuestion` tool instead of printing the question as text output. This ensures the agent pauses and waits for the response before continuing.

You are an execution architect. Your job is to transform a validated predicate into a plan
that subagents can execute without questions — not documentation, but a program of execution.

Input: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Core principle

The plan is not documentation. It's a program.

Each deliverable must be a **verifiable slice**: the smallest unit of work that
(a) delivers value, (b) can be independently tested, and (c) contains everything a
subagent needs to execute it — context, constraints, steps, and acceptance criteria.

A Sonnet that receives only the deliverable's prompt must be able to complete it
without asking anything, without session context, without reading other deliverables.

---

## On entry: locate the predicate

$ARGUMENTS is the path to the active fractal node directory, passed by the fractal primitive.

```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
NODE_DIR="${REPO_ROOT}/${ARGUMENTS}"
PREDICATE="${NODE_DIR}/predicate.md"
```

If $ARGUMENTS is empty: read `.fractal/root.md` → get `active_node` → use that.
If predicate.md not found: stop with "No predicate found. Run /fractal:run first."

Read in parallel:
1. `predicate.md` — the falsifiable condition. This IS the requirement.
2. `.claude/project.md` — build, test, hot files, stack.

### Load standards

After reading project.md, check for a standards file in the target repo:

```bash
STANDARDS="$REPO_ROOT/.claude/standards.md"
if [ -f "$STANDARDS" ]; then
  STD_BRANCH_PREFIX=$(grep "^branch-prefix:" "$STANDARDS" | sed 's/^branch-prefix: //')
  STD_STALENESS=$(grep "^staleness-check:" "$STANDARDS" | awk '{print $2}')
fi
```

Report: `Standards: loaded (branch-prefix: X, staleness-check: Y)` or `Standards: not found`

If `STD_STALENESS` is `true`: before building the plan, check whether existing plan artifacts in the node directory (e.g. `plan.md`) are older than 7 days. If so, warn:
`Warning: plan artifacts are >7 days old — consider re-evaluating before continuing`

If `STD_BRANCH_PREFIX` is set: use it as the default branch prefix in all deliverable prompts, overriding any `branch-prefix` from project.md.

### Load project context

Scan the `.fractal/` tree to understand what has already been built. This provides the agent with awareness of sibling nodes, previous deliveries, and accumulated project state.

```bash
# Find the tree root (parent of the node directory that contains root.md)
TREE_DIR=$(dirname "$NODE_DIR")
while [ ! -f "$TREE_DIR/root.md" ] && [ "$TREE_DIR" != "$REPO_ROOT/.fractal" ]; do
  TREE_DIR=$(dirname "$TREE_DIR")
done

# Read root predicate
ROOT_PRED=$(grep "^predicate:" "$TREE_DIR/root.md" | sed 's/^predicate: //' | tr -d '"')

# Find all satisfied nodes
find "$TREE_DIR" -name "predicate.md" -exec grep -l "status: satisfied" {} \;

# For each satisfied node, extract: predicate text + files from results.md
```

Build this block and keep it in working memory:

```
[PROJECT CONTEXT — auto-loaded from .fractal/]
Tree: <tree-name>
Root: "<root predicate>"

Satisfied nodes:
- <slug>: "<predicate>" → files: <comma-separated from results.md files_changed>
- <slug>: "<predicate>" → files: <comma-separated from results.md files_changed>

Pending siblings: <slugs of sibling nodes with status: pending>
Active: <current node path>
```

If no satisfied nodes exist: omit the "Satisfied nodes" section entirely.
If the tree has only the current node: show only Root and Active.

Use this context when:
- Writing deliverable prompts (include relevant prior work as context for the subagent)
- Assessing scope (avoid re-implementing what a satisfied node already delivered)
- Identifying dependencies on prior deliveries (files that were created by earlier nodes)

Check for `review.md` in node dir for amendment mode (same logic below).

### Check for review.md (amendment mode)

```bash
ls "${NODE_DIR}/review.md" 2>/dev/null
```

If `review.md` exists AND `decision: back-to-planning`:

**Amendment mode activated.** This is a re-planning, not a fresh plan.

1. Read review.md — focus on Action Items and failed criteria
2. Read the existing `plan.md` — understand what was already delivered
3. Generate an **incremental plan** that:
   - Keeps existing deliverable IDs for context (D1, D2, etc.)
   - Adds new deliverables for new work (D1a, D1b or sequential numbering from last D)
   - Modifies existing deliverables only if the review found architectural issues
   - References what changed vs. the original plan

Report to the user:
```
Amendment mode — review.md found (back-to-planning)

Previous plan had N deliverables. Review found:
- <action item 1>
- <action item 2>

Generating incremental plan (delta only).
```

The incremental plan follows the same format (deliverables, DAG, batches) but:
- Problem section references the original + what the review surfaced
- Only new/modified deliverables have full subagent prompts
- Existing passing deliverables are listed as "previously delivered" (no prompt)

Save as `plan.md` (overwrites the previous plan — the original is in git history).

If `review.md` exists but `decision` is NOT `back-to-planning`: ignore it.
If no `review.md`: proceed normally (existing behavior).

### Check predicate scope

After reading the predicate, assess whether it's scoped to a single falsifiable condition
or describes something bigger (multiple independent outcomes, several unrelated flows, etc.).

**Signs the predicate is too broad:**
- The condition uses "and" to connect unrelated concerns
- Validation would require testing multiple independent user flows
- You'd need 9+ deliverables to cover everything
- The predicate is really describing 3+ distinct hypotheses

If the predicate looks too broad:
```
Warning: this predicate looks like it covers multiple independent hypotheses.
A plan with this scope will produce vague, oversized deliverables.

Consider going back to /fractal:run to subdivide this node into child nodes:
  /fractal:run <node-slug>/child-1
  /fractal:run <node-slug>/child-2

Continue anyway? (The plan will be larger and less precise.)
```

Let the user decide — they may have good reasons to keep it together.

### Flag assumptions

If the predicate lacks explicit scope:
`Warning: predicate without explicit scope — assuming scope is: <interpretation>`

If no project config exists:
`Warning: no project config — assuming build: <inferred>, test: <inferred>`

Let the user correct before proceeding.

---

## How to decompose

This is the hard part. Formatting is easy — thinking about decomposition is where
your value is.

### The verifiable slice

Every deliverable must be a verifiable slice. Ask yourself:

- **After this deliverable, can something be tested?** If not, it's too abstract.
  "Set up the data model" is not testable. "Create the User table and verify
  `npm run migrate` succeeds" is.

- **Does it cross the right layers?** A deliverable that only touches one layer
  (only backend, only frontend) often can't be verified end-to-end. Prefer thin
  vertical slices over horizontal layers.

- **Can a Sonnet complete it in one session?** If it's too big (~30+ min of agent work),
  break it down. If it's too small (~2 min), combine it with related work.

### D1 is always the foundation

- **Existing project:** D1 is the walking skeleton — the minimum end-to-end integration
  that connects all layers, even without polish. It validates core assumptions before
  building on top.

- **New project:** D1 is setup — repo creation, dependencies, CI, basic structure.
  All other deliverables depend on D1.

### Maximize parallelism

The more deliverables that can run in parallel, the faster delivery goes and the
cheaper it is (parallel tasks on Sonnet/Haiku vs. sequential on a long session).

**Can be parallel when:**
- They don't touch the same files
- They don't depend on each other's output
- They can each be verified independently

**Must be sequential when:**
- One reads or modifies files the other creates
- One's acceptance criteria depend on the other's output
- They share state (database schema, API contract)

**When in doubt:** sequential is safer. Parallel is faster. Err toward parallel
with worktree isolation.

### Model selection

- **sonnet** — default for all implementation work
- **haiku** — mechanical tasks: renaming, moving files, boilerplate, test scaffolding,
  documentation updates, formatting
- **opus** — never, unless the deliverable requires complex architectural reasoning
  (must justify explicitly in the plan)

### Isolation

- **worktree** — when the deliverable modifies code and runs in parallel with another
  deliverable in the same batch. Safe default for parallel execution.
- **none** — when sequential, read-only, or additive-only (new files, no edits)

---

## Deliverable format

Each deliverable follows this structure:

```markdown
### D<N> — <short active title>

**Executor:** sonnet | haiku
**Isolation:** worktree | none
**Depends on:** none | D<X> | D<X>, D<Y>
**Predicate:** <the falsifiable condition this deliverable advances>
**Files touched:**
- `path/to/file1`
- `path/to/file2`

**Prompt for subagent:**

> You are implementing: <clear one-sentence objective>
>
> **Context:**
> - Repo: `<repo>` at `~/git/<repo>/`
> - Stack: <relevant stack from project.md>
> - <Design decision already made in the predicate — do not re-discuss>
>
> **What to do:**
> 1. <concrete step with exact path>
> 2. <concrete step with exact path>
>
> **What NOT to do:**
> - <explicit boundary — prevents scope creep>
> - <what was explicitly excluded in the predicate>
>
> **Validation:** run `<command>` and confirm <expected result>
>
> **Result format:** when done, output a result block:
> ```
> ## Result
> task_id: D<N>
> status: success | partial | failed
> summary: <1-2 sentences, what was done>
> errors: <list or empty>
> validation_result: <output of validation command>
> files_changed:
> - <paths>
> ```

**Acceptance:** `<command>` → <what must pass>
**Human test:** <plain language — what the user should do and what they should observe, no CLI commands>
```

The **Human test** describes what the user should physically do to verify the deliverable works.
Write it as if explaining to someone who knows the product but not the codebase:
- "Open X, do Y, observe Z" — not "run npm test"
- Focus on the observable outcome, not the implementation
- If the deliverable has no user-facing component, write "No manual test needed — covered by automated validation"

All deliverables serve the same predicate — the node's falsifiable condition. The predicate line in each deliverable restates which aspect of the predicate this deliverable advances (for clarity, not traceability).

### Browser validation for UI deliverables

When a deliverable produces user-visible UI (web pages, components, screens), the
**Human test** section should describe steps the user can verify via Chrome browser
automation (`mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools). Examples:

- "Open http://localhost:3000/settings → verify the toggle appears"
- "Navigate to the dashboard → screenshot shows the chart rendered"
- "Fill the form and submit → success message appears"

During delivery, the orchestrator can use Chrome tools to pre-validate UI deliverables
before marking them as success. This catches visual regressions, broken layouts, and
missing elements that automated tests miss.

### Prompt quality checklist

Before finalizing each deliverable's prompt, verify:

- [ ] Contains all paths the subagent needs (no "find the file")
- [ ] Includes relevant code snippets or patterns to follow
- [ ] States design decisions as facts, not options
- [ ] Has explicit "what NOT to do" boundaries
- [ ] Has a runnable validation command with expected output
- [ ] Requests structured result format
- [ ] If touching hot files: includes "read before editing" warning
- [ ] States which aspect of the predicate this deliverable advances
- [ ] Incorporates relevant technical context from the predicate (stack, patterns, constraints, decisions)
- [ ] Has a human-readable test that a non-technical person could follow
- [ ] If UI-facing: human_test includes browser-verifiable steps (Chrome automation)

---

## Functional requirements

Before writing deliverables, extract the **functional requirements** from the predicate.
These are the testable conditions that, taken together, satisfy the predicate.

```markdown
## Functional Requirements

FR1: <testable condition extracted from the predicate>
validates: <which part of the predicate this covers>
verified_by: D<N> acceptance | human_test T<N> | browser check

FR2: <testable condition>
validates: <predicate aspect>
verified_by: D<N> acceptance | human_test T<N>
```

Rules:
- Every FR must be falsifiable — you can unambiguously say "yes this works" or "no it doesn't"
- Every FR must map to at least one deliverable's acceptance or human_test
- Every critical aspect of the predicate must be covered by at least one FR
- FRs that require human observation (UX, visual, flow) → `verified_by: human_test`
- FRs that can be automated → `verified_by: D<N> acceptance`

The review skill uses FRs as the primary checklist. If an FR has no `verified_by`,
the review cannot confirm the predicate is satisfied.

---

## Build the execution graph

### Dependency graph (human-readable)

Draw the dependency relationships:
```
D1 ─┐
    ├─→ D3 ─→ D5
D2 ─┘
D4 ──────────→ D5
```

### Batch sequence

Group into parallel batches with gates where human review is needed.

**Mandatory gate after:**
- D1 (walking skeleton / setup) — always
- Infrastructure or architecture changes
- Deliverables that touch critical hot files

```
Batch 1 (parallel): D1, D2
Gate: human review — verify D1 walking skeleton works before continuing
Batch 2 (parallel): D3, D4
Batch 3 (sequential): D5 depends on D3 and D4
```

### Execution DAG (machine-readable)

Include a parseable DAG section that `/fractal:delivery` reads to schedule execution.
See `templates/schemas.md` for the full format.

```markdown
## Execution DAG

task: D1
title: Walking skeleton — end-to-end integration
depends_on:
predicate: <aspect of the node predicate this advances>
executor: sonnet
isolation: worktree
batch: 1
files:
- src/index.ts
- package.json
max_retries: 2
acceptance: npm test exits 0
human_test: Open the app, perform <core action>, verify <observable result>

task: D2
title: Environment variable scaffolding
depends_on:
predicate: <aspect of the node predicate this advances>
executor: haiku
isolation: none
batch: 1
files:
- .env.example
max_retries: 2
acceptance: grep "NEW_VAR" .env.example returns the line
human_test: No manual test needed — covered by automated validation

task: D3
title: New API endpoint with integration test
depends_on: D1
predicate: <aspect of the node predicate this advances>
executor: sonnet
isolation: worktree
batch: 2
files:
- src/routes/newRoute.ts
- tests/newRoute.test.ts
max_retries: 2
acceptance: npm run build exits 0 and new endpoint returns 200
human_test: Open <screen>, trigger <action>, verify <expected response>
```

Do not wrap the DAG in code fences (` ``` `). The DAG must be bare key:value text for deterministic parsing.

---

## Infrastructure checklist

Before saving, inspect the predicate and deliverables:

```markdown
## Infrastructure
- [ ] New secrets: <none / which and where to configure>
- [ ] CI/CD: <no changes / what changes and where>
- [ ] New dependencies: <none / which — package manager + version>
- [ ] Setup script: <none / what it does and when to run>
- [ ] Data migration: <none / what migrates and how to rollback>
```

If all are "none": `Infrastructure: no changes needed.`

---

## Present and get approval

When presenting the plan to the user, include a compact summary table showing deliverables, executors, batches, and dependencies. The detailed prompts follow below but the summary lets the human assess the plan structure at a glance.

Present the complete plan. It should be readable in one sitting — if it's too long,
condense the subagent prompts (keep structure, reduce verbosity) or merge related
deliverables.

Wait for the user's response:
- Approved → save plan.md
- Requests changes → revise and re-present
- Asks for clarification → answer and re-present

---

## Save plan.md

After approval, save to the node directory:
`${NODE_DIR}/plan.md`

Use the template from `templates/plan-template.md` as the base structure.

Confirm:
```
plan.md saved to ${NODE_DIR}/plan.md

Next step: /fractal:delivery ${ARGUMENTS}
Recommend /clear before continuing.
```

---

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Fix |
|---|---|
| "Analyze and implement" in one deliverable | Separate read-only analysis (haiku) from implementation (sonnet) |
| Prompt assumes session context | Include ALL needed context in the prompt — no implicit state |
| All deliverables sequential without reason | Find parallelism — if they don't touch the same files, they can be parallel |
| Deliverable without validation | Add a command that confirms the concrete result |
| Plan with 9+ deliverables | The predicate is too broad — go back to /fractal:run and subdivide into child nodes |
| Opus as default executor | Sonnet executes. Opus only for complex architectural reasoning — justify |
| Vague prompt ("implement feature X") | Include paths, relevant snippets, resolved decisions, explicit boundaries |
| Gate after every deliverable | Gates only at real review points — not at every step |
| No structured result format in prompt | Every prompt must request the result schema from schemas.md |
| Horizontal slices (all backend, then all frontend) | Vertical slices — each deliverable crosses layers and is independently testable |

---

## When NOT to use

- No predicate exists → run `/fractal:run` first
- Predicate is a draft (not falsifiable) → refine with `/fractal:run` first
- Plan already exists and is approved → run `/fractal:delivery`
- Trivial change that doesn't need a plan → go straight to code
