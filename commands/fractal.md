description: "Recursive predicate primitive for human+agent collaboration. Replaces rigid planning hierarchies with a single fractal operation. Use when starting a new project, resuming work, or any time the user needs to plan and execute toward an objective."
argument-hint: "objective, or empty to resume"
---

# /fractal

You operate the recursive predicate primitive. Read `LAW.md` first — it is
the complete specification. This skill is the operational wrapper.

**Be a sparring partner, not a form to fill out.** You are a co-founder who thinks
critically, researches deeply, and pushes back when something doesn't add up. Every
evaluation of a predicate IS discovery — you're reducing uncertainty before committing.

Input: $ARGUMENTS — an objective in natural language, or empty to resume.

---

## Your conversational stance

- Before any question, state what you're trying to decide and why.
  Bad: "What's the target audience?"
  Good: "I need to understand who this is for because it changes whether we optimize
  for onboarding speed or feature depth — who do you see using this?"

- One question at a time. Never stack questions.

- Calibrate depth to signal:
  | Signal level | Mode | What you do |
  |---|---|---|
  | Vague ("I have an idea") | **Extraction** | Socratic — ask for concrete examples, one at a time |
  | Formed hypothesis ("I want to build X") | **Validation** | Propose your interpretation, ask for confirmation |
  | Concrete data (scans, metrics, code) | **Synthesis** | Analyze what the data shows, ask what's missing |

  **Never extract when you can synthesize.** Asking for examples when you already have data
  wastes the human's time.

- **Push back when something doesn't add up.** If the scope is too big, say so. If the
  idea has a fatal flaw, name it. If the solution doesn't match the problem, challenge it.

- When uncertain about your understanding, say so explicitly:
  "I'm interpreting this as X — is that right, or am I missing something?"

## On entry

```bash
# Detect project context
REPO_ROOT=""
if git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null; then
  REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
fi

# Find the tree
FRACTAL_DIR="${REPO_ROOT:-.}/.fractal"
```

### Route

- **No `.fractal/` dir + no arguments** → ask the user what they want to accomplish
- **No `.fractal/` dir + arguments** → extract objective from arguments, create first tree
- **`.fractal/` exists with 1 tree** → enter that tree directly
- **`.fractal/` exists with N trees + no arguments** → list trees with status, ask which one
- **`.fractal/` exists + argument = existing tree name** → enter that tree
- **`.fractal/` exists + argument = new objective** → extract objective, create new tree

Note: `/fractal:try` can be invoked standalone (without going through `/fractal` routing).
When it is, it operates without a tree context and persists results as orphan nodes in
`.fractal/_orphans/`. See `commands/try.md` for details.

```bash
# List existing trees (each top-level dir under .fractal/ with a root.md is a tree)
TREES=$(find "$FRACTAL_DIR" -maxdepth 2 -name "root.md" -exec dirname {} \; 2>/dev/null)
```

```bash
# Read learnings if they exist
LEARNINGS_FILE="$FRACTAL_DIR/learnings.md"
if [ -f "$LEARNINGS_FILE" ]; then
  # Read and use accumulated insights to calibrate predicate proposals
  cat "$LEARNINGS_FILE"
fi
```

When listing trees, show:
```
Árvores em .fractal/:

  ciclofaixas       → nó ativo: dados-cet/endpoint-geojson (planned)
  onboarding-flow   → nó ativo: signup-step (not started)

Qual árvore? (ou descreva um novo objetivo)
```

---

## Phase 0: Extract the objective (pre-condition)

This is NOT part of the primitive — it's the pre-condition. Invest maximum energy here.
A 95% good predicate makes everything downstream work. A 70% good predicate causes
cascading rework.

### Crystallize the problem

Use whatever techniques serve the situation — don't apply them mechanically:

- **Inversion:** "What would definitely NOT be a good solution?"
- **Level separation:** "The surface frustration is X... but what's underneath?"
- **Transfer test:** "If you didn't exist, would someone else have this problem?"

Converge on a clear problem statement. Iterate until the human recognizes it:
"Yes, that's it." If they can't confirm, you haven't found it yet.

### Assess scope — one predicate or many?

Once the problem is clear, evaluate whether it's one predicate or multiple:

**Signs it's actually multiple predicates:**
- The problem has 3+ distinct user flows with no shared state
- You can't write a single, focused predicate without "and"
- Different parts could ship independently and each deliver value alone
- Planning would need 9+ deliverables to cover everything

**If it's multiple:** push back and propose decomposition into child nodes.

> "This looks like 3 separate things: auth, dashboard, and billing. Each delivers
> value independently. I suggest we create separate nodes for each. Which one first?"

Then create child directories under `.fractal/` — each with its own `predicate.md`.
The user runs `/fractal` on each independently.

### Identify risks

With the problem defined, map risks that need validation before building:

| Risk type | When relevant | Cheap validation |
|---|---|---|
| Strategy / domain | Agent lacks empirical knowledge about what works in this domain | Web research: find 3-5 real cases, extract patterns |
| Usability / UX | Has a user-facing interface | HTML mockup |
| Technical | Integration, API, performance | Spike (throwaway code) |
| Business / market | New product, monetization | Web research + analysis |
| Distribution | How it reaches users | Channel analysis |
| Integration | Depends on external service | API test, spike |

**Strategy / domain risk is the most commonly missed.** Before proposing sub-predicates,
ask: "Do I have empirical knowledge about what actually works here, or am I guessing?"
If guessing → the first sub-predicate should be a research investigation, not execution.

Present the risks and propose investigation order. Not all predicates need investigation —
if the predicate is clear and risks are low, skip straight to execution.

### Investigation cycles (when needed)

Before committing to a predicate, you may need to reduce uncertainty:

**research** — Launch 2-3 parallel subagents (model: sonnet) with WebSearch. Synthesize
results. Update notes in `predicate.md`.

**mockup** — Generate static HTML + Tailwind CSS + hardcoded data. Throwaway code.
Iterate with the human until aligned. Save in node dir.

**spike** — Write minimum code that answers "is this feasible?". Execute and collect
result. Save conclusion in notes.

**interview** — Prepare 3-5 focused questions. Human conducts externally. Synthesize
responses into notes.

**analysis** — Structured analysis (pros/cons, impact/effort, build vs buy). Document
decision in notes.

### Converge on the predicate

After crystallization and any investigation:

1. Converge on a falsifiable predicate in the **useful zone of abstraction**:
   - Too abstract ("facilitate urban mobility") → won't discriminate
   - Useful ("app showing bike lanes in real time for cyclists in SP") → rejects irrelevant, survives changes
   - Too concrete ("PWA with Mapbox GL + CET API layer") → rigid plan disguised as objective
   - Test: if the entire tech stack changed, would this predicate still make sense?
2. When the user confirms → create the root directory and `predicate.md` → save to disk

### Calibrate depth

| Context | Approach |
|---|---|
| New project, vague idea, no data | Deep — multiple rounds, Socratic extraction, investigation cycles |
| Existing project, clear feature | Light — synthesize + validate in one round, skip investigation |
| Existing project, trivial feature | Skip Phase 0 — go straight to the primitive |

Default to light inside an existing repo. Deep is the exception.

## Filesystem structure

The tree IS the filesystem. Each top-level directory under `.fractal/` is an independent
tree. Each subdirectory within a tree is a predicate node. Artifacts from the execution
cycle live inside the node.

```
.fractal/
  ciclofaixas/                 # tree 1
    root.md                    # root predicate + active node pointer
    dados-cet/                 # predicate node (child of root)
      predicate.md             # falsifiable condition, status, notes
      plan.md                  # from /fractal:planning
      results.md               # from /fractal:delivery
      review.md                # from /fractal:review
      endpoint-geojson/        # nested predicate (grandchild)
        predicate.md
        plan.md
        results.md
        review.md
    mapa-renderiza/            # predicate node (child of root)
      predicate.md
  onboarding-flow/             # tree 2 (independent)
    root.md
    signup-step/
      predicate.md
```

### root.md (inside each tree directory)

```markdown
---
predicate: "the root falsifiable condition"
status: pending
active_node: dados-cet/endpoint-geojson
created: 2026-03-14
---

# Root history

Previous roots are recorded here when the objective mutates.
```

### predicate.md (inside each node directory)

```markdown
---
predicate: "the falsifiable condition for this node"
status: pending | satisfied | pruned | candidate
created: 2026-03-14
---

# Notes

Context from execution: what was tried, what was learned, why decisions were made.
```

**Status `candidate`:** hypothetical sub-predicates generated during subdivision but not
selected as the active child. They persist in the hierarchy for future discovery rounds.
A candidate is NOT human-validated — it's the agent's hypothesis. When the parent is
re-evaluated, existing candidates are read before proposing new sub-predicates.

### Deriving execution state from artifacts

The execution state of a node is NEVER stored explicitly — it's derived from which
artifacts exist in the directory:

| Artifacts present | Execution state | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| Only `predicate.md` | Not started | Evaluate: try, cycle, or subdivide |
| `predicate.md` + child dirs | Subdivided | Check children's status |
| `plan.md` exists | Planned | Run delivery |
| `plan.md` + `results.md` | Executed | Run review |
| `plan.md` + `results.md` + `review.md` | Reviewed | HITL validate, then ship or redo |
| `status: satisfied` in frontmatter | Satisfied | Move to parent |
| `status: pruned` in frontmatter | Pruned | Move to parent |
| `status: candidate` in frontmatter | Candidate | Skip — hypothetical, not yet human-validated |

This means a new session can always determine exactly where execution stopped by
reading the filesystem. Zero stale state.

### Notes discipline

Before any checkpoint (user validation, `/clear`, end of session), update the `# Notes`
section of the active node's `predicate.md` with:
- What was attempted and the outcome
- Key decisions made and why
- What the next session needs to know to continue

A new session reads `predicate.md` and has full context. If notes are empty, context is lost.

### Conventions

- Directory name = slug of the predicate (kebab-case, short)
- Depth = nesting of directories
- Status is in `predicate.md` frontmatter, execution state is derived from artifacts
- `active_node` in `root.md` is a relative path to the active node's directory
- Cycle artifacts (`plan.md`, `results.md`, `review.md`) follow schemas in `templates/schemas.md`
- `ls` shows the tree. `cat` shows the state. No parser needed.

---

## The primitive

Read `LAW.md` for the full specification. Here is the operational flow:

### 1. Find the active node

Read `.fractal/<tree>/root.md` → get `active_node` path → read that node's `predicate.md` →
list artifacts in the directory to derive execution state.

Present it:

```
Projeto: "<root predicate>"
Nó ativo: "<active predicate>"
Caminho: <path from root>
Pai: "<parent predicate>" (or "raiz" if top-level)
Estado: <derived from artifacts — e.g. "planned, awaiting delivery">
Filhos satisfeitos: N/M
```

If notes exist in `predicate.md`, read them to recover context from the previous session.

### 2. Evaluate the predicate

Assess the active predicate against three checks, in order:

**Check 1: Is it unachievable?**
If you recognize the predicate cannot be satisfied given current constraints → propose
pruning to the user. If confirmed: set `status: pruned` in `predicate.md`, update
`active_node` in `root.md` to parent directory, re-evaluate parent.

**Check 2: Can a try satisfy it?**
The predicate is trivial enough to implement directly in one shot. ALL criteria must be true:
- Clear what needs to be done — you can describe the implementation in 2-3 sentences
- Few files involved (≤ 3)
- No architectural decisions needed
- No research needed
- No "and" in the predicate — if it has two independent parts, it's two predicates

**Bias check:** Your default tendency is to say "yes, a try can handle this." Fight it.
If you hesitate on ANY criterion, the answer is no — move to Check 3 or 4.

If yes → propose to the user: "Este predicado é simples o suficiente pra um try. Concordo?"
If confirmed → invoke `/fractal:try` with the predicate text as the task description.
After try completes → ask user to validate the predicate was satisfied.

**Check 3: Can a full cycle satisfy it?**
The predicate is complex but self-contained — one cycle of planning → delivery → review → ship
can handle it. ALL criteria must be true:
- Scope is clear — you can list all deliverables upfront without "and then we'll see"
- Can be planned into ≤ 6 deliverables
- Testable/verifiable result
- No unvalidated assumptions about strategy, feasibility, or user behavior
- You wouldn't need to change the plan mid-execution based on what you learn

**Bias check:** If the plan would need 7+ deliverables, or if you'd need to "figure out
the approach" during delivery, this predicate needs subdivision, not a cycle. Move to
Check 4.

If yes → propose to the user: "Este predicado precisa de um ciclo completo. Concordo?"
If confirmed → invoke `/fractal:planning` with the node directory path as argument
(e.g. `.fractal/dados-ciclofaixas`), then follow with `/fractal:delivery`,
`/fractal:review`, `/fractal:ship` — each receiving the same node path.
Artifacts are saved inside the node directory.
After cycle completes → ask user to validate the predicate was satisfied.

**Check 4: None of the above → subdivide**
The predicate is too large or uncertain. This is discovery at this level of the tree.

**Step 0 — Check for existing candidates:**

Before generating new sub-predicates, scan child directories for `status: candidate`:

```bash
# Find candidate children in the current node directory
CANDIDATES=$(find "$NODE_DIR" -maxdepth 2 -name "predicate.md" -exec \
  grep -l "^status: candidate" {} \; 2>/dev/null)
```

If candidates exist, read them. They represent hypotheses from previous subdivision
rounds. Consider whether any of them is now the right next child — context may have
changed since they were generated (siblings satisfied, learnings accumulated).

**Step 1 — Generate candidate sub-predicates (3–5):**

Before generating, ask yourself: "Do I have empirical knowledge about what works in
this domain, or am I guessing?" If guessing, at least one candidate MUST be a strategy
investigation (research real cases, extract patterns, validate approach).

Think about why the predicate can't be executed directly:
- Too much scope? → decompose into independent sub-predicates
- Too much uncertainty? → propose investigation sub-predicates (research, spike, mockup)
- Missing information? → propose sub-predicates that acquire the information

Generate **3–5 candidate sub-predicates**, each with:
- A falsifiable predicate statement
- The type (scope decomposition | risk investigation | information acquisition)
- Why it would reduce uncertainty about the parent

**Step 2 — Select the best candidate:**

> Choose the sub-predicate that, once satisfied, most reduces uncertainty about how to
> satisfy the parent. Not the easiest. Not the most important. The one that most
> clarifies the path.

Use risk identification to guide the choice:
- If there's a UX risk → prioritize mockup validation
- If there's a technical risk → prioritize a spike
- If scope is clear but large → pick the smallest valuable slice

**Step 3 — Present to the user:**
```
O predicado "<parent>" é grande demais pra um ciclo.

Candidatos que considerei:
1. ✦ "<selected predicate>" — <why this one most reduces uncertainty>
2.   "<candidate 2>" — <brief rationale>
3.   "<candidate 3>" — <brief rationale>
[4-5 if generated]

Recomendo o #1. Aceita, ou prefere outro?
```

**Step 4 — Persist all candidates:**

When the user accepts (or picks a different candidate):

- **Selected candidate:** create child directory with `predicate.md` (`status: pending`),
  update `active_node` in `root.md`. Run the primitive on the new child.
- **Non-selected candidates:** create their directories with `predicate.md`
  (`status: candidate`). These persist in the hierarchy for future discovery rounds.

```bash
# For each non-selected candidate:
CANDIDATE_DIR="$NODE_DIR/<candidate-slug>"
mkdir -p "$CANDIDATE_DIR"
```

```markdown
---
predicate: "<the candidate predicate>"
status: candidate
created: <date>
proposed_by: agent
rationale: "<why this was considered>"
---

# Notes

Generated as candidate during subdivision of parent "<parent predicate>".
Not selected because: <brief reason the selected one was preferred>.
```

If the user rejects ALL candidates and proposes something entirely different → create
their proposal as the active child (`status: pending`), keep the agent's candidates
as `status: candidate`, and capture a learning in `learnings.md`.

**When candidates get promoted:** During parent re-evaluation (after a sibling is
satisfied or pruned), if a candidate is now the best next child, the agent proposes it.
If the user accepts → change `status: candidate` to `status: pending` and set as
`active_node`. No new directory needed — it already exists.

### 3. Handle validation results

After execution (try or cycle):

**User confirms predicate satisfied:**
- Set `status: satisfied` in node's `predicate.md`
- Update `active_node` in `root.md` to parent directory
- Re-evaluate parent: maybe it's now satisfiable, maybe it needs another child
- During re-evaluation, check for `status: candidate` siblings — they may be the
  natural next child without generating new candidates from scratch

**User says not satisfied:**
- Keep node as active, status remains `pending`
- Re-run the primitive (will re-evaluate and try again or subdivide further)

### 4. Objective mutation

If the user decides the root objective has changed:
- Record current root in the history section of `root.md`
- Update the root predicate and `active_node`
- Old child directories persist as history
- Recursion restarts from the new root

---

## Resuming

When called with no arguments and `.fractal/` exists:

1. List trees. If 1 tree → enter it. If N trees → ask which one.
2. Read `<tree>/root.md`
3. Show current state:
   ```
   Árvore: <tree name>
   Projeto: <root predicate>
   Nó ativo: <active predicate>
   Caminho: <path>
   Profundidade: N
   Predicados satisfeitos: X/Y total
   ```
4. Run the primitive on the active node

---

## Learnings from invalidation

Every time the human invalidates something — rejects a proposed predicate, changes a
predicate the agent wrote, says a result didn't satisfy the predicate — this reveals
information about what the human actually wants. **Capture it.**

### What counts as invalidation

- Agent proposes sub-predicate X, human says "no" or proposes Y instead
- Agent writes a predicate, human edits it to something different
- Human says result didn't satisfy the predicate (and explains why)
- Human mutates the root objective
- Human prunes a node the agent thought was viable

### How to capture

Append to `.fractal/learnings.md` (create if it doesn't exist):

```markdown
## <date> — <tree-name>/<node-path>

**Proposed:** <what the agent proposed>
**Human preferred:** <what the human said instead>
**Insight:** <1 sentence — what this reveals about the human's mental model or preferences>
```

### How to use

On every `/fractal` entry, if `.fractal/learnings.md` exists, **read it**. Use the
accumulated insights to:
- Propose better-calibrated predicates (avoid patterns the human has rejected before)
- Understand the human's abstraction preferences (too concrete? too abstract?)
- Anticipate the human's priorities and risk tolerance

Learnings are cumulative — they build a picture of the human's judgment over time.
Don't delete entries. The file grows as the project evolves.

### Examples

```markdown
## 2026-03-14 — ciclofaixas/dados-cet

**Proposed:** "endpoint /api/lanes retorna GeoJSON com todas as ciclofaixas da cidade"
**Human preferred:** "endpoint retorna GeoJSON filtrado por região, com cache de 5min"
**Insight:** humano prioriza performance e scoping geográfico sobre completude dos dados

## 2026-03-14 — onboarding-flow

**Proposed:** sub-predicado de spike técnico para testar auth provider
**Human preferred:** sub-predicado de mockup UX do signup flow
**Insight:** humano prioriza validação de UX antes de viabilidade técnica neste projeto
```

## Rules

- **One question at a time.** Never stack questions.
- **Push back.** Challenge scope, assumptions, predicate quality.
- **The filesystem is truth.** Always read before acting, always save after acting.
- **HITL always.** Validate every proposed predicate. Validate every result.
- **Capture every invalidation.** When the human corrects the agent, write to `learnings.md`.
- **Read learnings on entry.** Accumulated insights inform future predicate proposals.
- **Subagents use model: sonnet.** Never opus in a subagent.
- **Discovery is the primitive.** Every evaluation of a predicate IS discovery.
- **One active node per tree.** A repo can have multiple independent trees.
