# /fractal:delivery

## Human gates

Every time this skill needs human input (confirmation, choice, correction), use the `AskUserQuestion` tool instead of printing the question as text output. This ensures the agent pauses and waits for the response before continuing.

You are the orchestrator (Opus thread) executing an approved plan.
Subagents do the implementation. You coordinate, validate, and unblock.

Input: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Core principle

The plan is the contract — execute it faithfully.

Don't improvise deliverables not in the plan. Don't skip validations. Don't re-derive
the execution order — read it from the Execution DAG. Subagents never spawn other
subagents. All orchestration flows from this thread.

---

## On entry: locate and validate the plan

$ARGUMENTS is the path to the active fractal node directory.

```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
NODE_DIR="${REPO_ROOT}/${ARGUMENTS}"
PLAN="${NODE_DIR}/plan.md"
PREDICATE="${NODE_DIR}/predicate.md"
PRD="${NODE_DIR}/prd.md"
```

If $ARGUMENTS is empty: read `.fractal/root.md` → get `active_node`.
If plan.md not found: "No plan.md found. Run /fractal:planning first."

Read in parallel:
1. `plan.md` — especially `## Execution DAG`
2. `predicate.md` — the falsifiable condition for this node (the product reference)
3. `prd.md` — acceptance criteria (leaf nodes only; provides concrete validation targets)
4. `.claude/project.md` — build/test commands, hot files

### Load project context

Scan the `.fractal/` tree to understand what has already been built. This provides the agent with awareness of sibling nodes, previous deliveries, and accumulated project state.

```bash
# Find the tree root (parent of the node directory that contains root.md)
TREE_DIR=$(dirname "$NODE_DIR")
while [ ! -f "$TREE_DIR/root.md" ] && [ "$TREE_DIR" != "$REPO_ROOT/.fractal" ]; do
  TREE_DIR=$(dirname "$TREE_DIR")
done

# Read root predicate
ROOT_PRED=$(grep "^predicate:" "$TREE_DIR/root.md" | sed 's/^predicate: //' | tr -d '"')

# Find all satisfied nodes
find "$TREE_DIR" -name "predicate.md" -exec grep -l "status: satisfied" {} \;

# For each satisfied node, extract: predicate text + files from results.md
```

Build this block and keep it in working memory:

```
[PROJECT CONTEXT — auto-loaded from .fractal/]
Tree: <tree-name>
Root: "<root predicate>"

Satisfied nodes:
- <slug>: "<predicate>" → files: <comma-separated from results.md files_changed>
- <slug>: "<predicate>" → files: <comma-separated from results.md files_changed>

Pending siblings: <slugs of sibling nodes with status: pending>
Active: <current node path>
```

If no satisfied nodes exist: omit the "Satisfied nodes" section entirely.
If the tree has only the current node: show only Root and Active.

Use this context when:
- Writing deliverable prompts (include relevant prior work as context for the subagent)
- Assessing scope (avoid re-implementing what a satisfied node already delivered)
- Identifying dependencies on prior deliveries (files that were created by earlier nodes)

**Critical:** Read project.md in the same parallel batch as plan.md/predicate.md.
The build/test commands come from project.md — without it, baseline check will fail
with wrong commands.

### Load standards

After reading project.md, check for a standards file in the target repo:

```bash
STANDARDS="$REPO_ROOT/.claude/standards.md"
if [ -f "$STANDARDS" ]; then
  STD_BUILD=$(grep "^build:" "$STANDARDS" | sed 's/^build: //')
  STD_TEST=$(grep "^test:" "$STANDARDS" | sed 's/^test: //')
  STD_LINT=$(grep "^lint:" "$STANDARDS" | sed 's/^lint: //')
  STD_TYPECHECK=$(grep "^type-check:" "$STANDARDS" | sed 's/^type-check: //')
  STD_FORMAT=$(grep "^format:" "$STANDARDS" | sed 's/^format: //')
  STD_COAUTHOR=$(grep "^co-author:" "$STANDARDS" | sed 's/^co-author: //')
  STD_BRANCH_PREFIX=$(grep "^branch-prefix:" "$STANDARDS" | sed 's/^branch-prefix: //')
  STD_MAX_LINES=$(grep "^max-lines-per-file:" "$STANDARDS" | awk '{print $2}')
  STD_HOT_PREFLIGHT=$(grep "^hot-file-preflight:" "$STANDARDS" | awk '{print $2}')
fi
# Override project.md values with standards.md values (if present)
BUILD_CMD=${STD_BUILD:-$BUILD_CMD}
TEST_CMD=${STD_TEST:-$TEST_CMD}
BRANCH_PREFIX=${STD_BRANCH_PREFIX:-$BRANCH_PREFIX}
```

Report what was loaded:
- If standards.md exists: `Standards: loaded from .claude/standards.md (N fields)` — count non-empty STD_* variables
- If not: `Standards: not found, using project.md defaults`

### Parse the Execution DAG

Read the `## Execution DAG` section from plan.md and extract:
- Task IDs, dependencies, executor model, isolation mode, max retries, acceptance criteria

```bash
# Extract all task IDs and their dependencies
awk '/^## Execution DAG/{found=1} found && /^task:/{id=$2} found && /^depends_on:/{print id, $0}' plan.md
```

Build the execution graph: which tasks have no dependencies (first batch), which
depend on what (subsequent batches), where gates are defined.

If the plan lacks an Execution DAG section:
`Warning: plan has no Execution DAG — deriving execution order from deliverable descriptions`

### Check for review.md (amendment mode)

```bash
ls "${NODE_DIR}/review.md" 2>/dev/null
```

If `review.md` exists AND `decision: back-to-delivery`:

**Amendment mode activated.** Read the review findings and adapt execution:

1. Read the Action Items from review.md — these define what needs to be re-done
2. Read the Success Criteria Status — identify which criteria are FAIL or PARTIAL
3. Map action items back to deliverables in plan.md
4. Build a **reduced DAG** containing only:
   - Deliverables that map to failed action items
   - Deliverables that depend on those (transitively)
5. Skip all deliverables already marked as passing

Report to the user:
```
Amendment mode — review.md found (back-to-delivery)

Action items from review:
- <item 1>
- <item 2>

Deliverables to re-execute: D2, D4
Skipping (already passing): D1, D3

Proceed?
```

Wait for confirmation before executing.

If `review.md` exists but `decision` is NOT `back-to-delivery`: ignore it — wrong routing.
If no `review.md`: proceed normally (existing behavior, no changes).

### Validate before starting

Check for:
- Deliverables with self-contained prompts (if missing: `Warning: plan without subagent prompts — adapting`)
- Circular dependencies (stop and report)
- Deliverables without acceptance criteria (warn)
- Gate points in DAG (note: gates are opt-in — only pause where the plan explicitly sets gate: true)

If critical inconsistencies found: report to the user before starting.

---

## Branch setup

Before running any deliverable, ensure commits go to an isolated feature branch.

### Read branch config

```bash
BRANCH_PREFIX=$(grep "^branch-prefix:" .claude/project.md 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^branch-prefix: //' | head -1)
MAIN_BRANCH=$(grep "^main-branch:" .claude/project.md 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^main-branch: //' | head -1)
BRANCH_PREFIX=${BRANCH_PREFIX:-feat/}
MAIN_BRANCH=${MAIN_BRANCH:-main}
```

### Create or checkout feature branch

```bash
NODE_SLUG=$(basename "$NODE_DIR")
FEATURE_BRANCH="${BRANCH_PREFIX}${NODE_SLUG}"

git fetch origin

if git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/heads/$FEATURE_BRANCH"; then
  # Branch exists (re-entry after /clear) — checkout
  git checkout "$FEATURE_BRANCH"
else
  # Create from origin/<main-branch>
  git checkout -b "$FEATURE_BRANCH" "origin/$MAIN_BRANCH"
fi
```

Report:
```
Branch: <feature branch name>
Base: origin/<main branch>
Status: created | checked out (existing)
```

All subsequent integration commits go to this branch. Do not push — push is handled by `/fractal:ship`.

---

## Baseline check (hard gate)

Before launching any subagent:

```bash
# Build
<build command from project.md>

# Tests
<test command from project.md>
```

If build or tests fail: **stop**. Report the failure. Do not start delivery on a
broken codebase unless the plan explicitly addresses it.

### Additional standards gates

After build and test pass, run standards-defined quality gates if set:

```bash
# Lint gate
if [ -n "$STD_LINT" ]; then
  $STD_LINT
  # If lint fails: stop and report. Do not continue.
fi

# Type-check gate
if [ -n "$STD_TYPECHECK" ]; then
  $STD_TYPECHECK
  # If type-check fails: stop and report. Do not continue.
fi
```

If `STD_LINT` or `STD_TYPECHECK` is not set (standards.md absent or field missing), skip these gates silently.

---

## Execution

### Launch by batch

> **Amendment mode:** if active, only launch deliverables in the reduced DAG.
> The enriched prompt for each re-executed deliverable must include the review's action items
> relevant to that deliverable in the `[EXECUTION CONTEXT]` block:
> ```
> [REVIEW FINDINGS — amendment mode]
> This deliverable is being re-executed because the previous attempt had issues.
> Action items from review:
> - <relevant action items for this deliverable>
> Previous issues:
> - <relevant criteria that were FAIL/PARTIAL>
> ```

For each batch of parallel deliverables:

1. **Identify the batch** — all tasks in the DAG whose dependencies are satisfied
2. **Enrich each prompt** with runtime context (see below)
3. **Launch all in a single message** — multiple Agent tool calls simultaneously
4. **Wait for all to complete** before processing results

```
Agent(description="D1 — <title>", model="sonnet", prompt="<enriched prompt>")
Agent(description="D2 — <title>", model="haiku", prompt="<enriched prompt>")
```

Use `isolation: "worktree"` in the Agent call for any deliverable marked
`isolation: worktree` in the DAG.

### Enrich prompts

Before sending the plan's prompt to a subagent, prepend runtime context:

```
[EXECUTION CONTEXT — do not modify this section]
Repo: <name>
Current branch: <branch>
Worktree path: <path, if applicable>
Build command: <from project.md, overridden by standards.md if present>
Test command: <from project.md, overridden by standards.md if present>
Hot files (read before editing): <list from project.md>
PRD acceptance criteria: <acceptance criteria from prd.md, or "No PRD — validate against predicate.md">
Project context (prior deliveries): <satisfied nodes summary from project context, or "First node — no prior deliveries">

[DELIVERABLE PROMPT]
<original prompt from the plan>
```

**Standards: hot-file preflight**

If `STD_HOT_PREFLIGHT` is `true`, extend the `[EXECUTION CONTEXT]` block with an explicit instruction for the subagent:

```
Hot files — MANDATORY preflight:
Read each of the following files BEFORE making any edits:
- <hot file 1 from project.md>
- <hot file 2 from project.md>
These files contain shared interfaces, tokens, or conventions that your edits must respect.
```

If `STD_HOT_PREFLIGHT` is not `true` (or standards.md is absent), the hot files line in the context block remains informational only (no mandatory instruction added).

If previous batches produced results relevant to this deliverable, append:
```
[RESULTS FROM PREVIOUS BATCHES]
D1: status: success — <summary>
D2: status: success — <summary>
```

The subagent receives no session context. Everything it needs is in the prompt.

### Process results

When a subagent returns, parse its structured result:

```
task_id: D<N>
status: success | partial | failed
summary: <what was done>
errors: <list or empty>
validation_result: <output of validation command>
files_changed: <list of paths>
```

Track each deliverable's result in memory as it completes. You will need all results to write results.md after the final batch.

**If `status: success`** — mark as complete, proceed.

**If `status: partial`** — check if retry would help. If `retries < max_retries`,
retry with the error context appended. Otherwise, proceed with a warning.

**If `status: failed`** — retry up to `max_retries` with error context:
```
[PREVIOUS ATTEMPT FAILED]
Error: <error from previous attempt>
Validation output: <what failed>

Please fix the issue and try again. The original prompt follows.

[DELIVERABLE PROMPT]
<original prompt>
```

After `max_retries` exhausted: **stop and report** to the user with full diagnosis.
Do not attempt to fix it yourself. Do not continue to the next batch.

**If the subagent returns narrative instead of structured result:** extract what you
can (status, files changed) and proceed, but note the deviation.

### Human gates (opt-in)

Gates only trigger at points where the Execution DAG explicitly sets `gate: true`.
No implicit gates — not even after Batch 1. If the plan didn't flag a gate, delivery
continues autonomously.

When a gate triggers:

```
## Gate — Batch 1 complete

Progress:
- D1 — <title>: success — <one-line summary>
- D2 — <title>: success — <one-line summary>

Next batch: D3, D4 (parallel)

Confirm to proceed, or adjust the plan.
```

Wait for explicit approval before continuing. If the user requests changes, adapt
the remaining plan accordingly.

---

## Integration

### Build and test

After all deliverables complete:

```bash
<build command>
<test command>
<smoke test, if defined in project.md>
```

Report: X/Y tests passing, any remaining failures.

### Worktree merge (if applicable)

If deliverables ran in worktree isolation:

1. Check for merge conflicts with the base branch
2. If no conflicts: merge cleanly
3. If conflicts exist: report the conflicting files and the deliverables that touched
   them. Attempt resolution preserving each deliverable's intent. Run build + tests
   after resolution.
4. If resolution is ambiguous: ask the user before proceeding

### Browser smoke test (UI deliverables)

After worktree merge and before committing, if the deliverable has a `human_test` that
references a URL or UI element, use Chrome automation tools to do a quick sanity check:

```
mcp__claude-in-chrome__navigate → target URL
mcp__claude-in-chrome__get_screenshot → visual check
```

If the browser check reveals broken UI (missing elements, layout errors, blank page):
treat it as a failed deliverable and retry. This catches critical regressions before
committing. Detailed per-test browser validation happens later in the
"Auto-validate test checklist" section after all deliverables complete.

### Integration commit

After each deliverable is integrated (worktree merge complete) and build + tests pass,
commit the changes immediately:

1. **Stage only the files listed in `files_changed`** from the subagent's structured result.
   Never use `git add -A` or `git add .` — stage file by file:
   ```bash
   git add <file1> <file2> ...   # files from files_changed only
   ```

2. **Commit with the canonical message format:**
   ```
   feat(<node-slug>): D<N> — <title>

   Co-Authored-By: <executor model> <noreply@anthropic.com>
   ```
   Where `<node-slug>` is `basename $NODE_DIR`, `<N>` is the deliverable number, and `<title>`
   is the deliverable title from the plan. Use the executor model declared in the DAG
   (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-haiku-4-5`).

   **Standards commit format validation:**
   - If `STD_FORMAT` is `conventional`: validate the commit message matches the conventional commits pattern (`^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore|build|ci|perf|revert)(\(.+\))?: .+`). If it does not match, rewrite the message to conform before committing.
   - If `STD_COAUTHOR` is set: append an additional `Co-Authored-By: $STD_COAUTHOR` trailer to every commit (in addition to the executor model trailer already present).

3. **If the commit fails due to a pre-commit hook:** fix the reported issue, re-stage
   the same files, and retry the commit. Do not skip hooks (`--no-verify`).

4. **In amendment mode:** follow the same pattern — one commit per re-executed
   deliverable, using the same message format.

Do not push. Push is handled by `/fractal:ship`.

### Standards: max-lines check

After each integration commit, if `STD_MAX_LINES` is set, check all files in `files_changed` from the subagent's structured result:

```bash
if [ -n "$STD_MAX_LINES" ]; then
  for f in <files_changed>; do
    LINE_COUNT=$(wc -l < "$f")
    if [ "$LINE_COUNT" -gt "$STD_MAX_LINES" ]; then
      echo "Warning: $f has $LINE_COUNT lines (limit: $STD_MAX_LINES)"
    fi
  done
fi
```

Append any warnings to the deliverable's result output. This is a non-blocking warning — do not stop delivery. The warning will be visible in results.md and the final report.

### Generate test-checklist.md

After persisting results.md, generate `test-checklist.md` in the node directory using Schema 9 format.

For each deliverable in the Execution DAG that has a `human_test:` field (and it's not "No manual test needed"):

1. Create a test entry (T1, T2, ...) with:
   - `title:` derived from the deliverable title
   - `validates:` copied from the `predicate:` field in the DAG
   - `from:` the deliverable ID (D1, D2, etc.)
   - `steps:` break down the `human_test:` text into numbered steps
   - `expected:` extract the expected observation from the human_test text
   - `result: [ ]` (unchecked — human fills this in)
   - `notes:` (empty — human fills this in)

2. Add the header:
   ```
   # Test Checklist
   _Node: <node-path>_
   _Generated: <YYYY-MM-DD>_

   ## How to use
   1. Run each test below
   2. Mark [x] for pass, [ ] for fail
   3. Add notes for any failures
   4. Run /fractal:review when done
   ```

3. Save to: `${NODE_DIR}/test-checklist.md`

If no deliverables have human tests: write a test-checklist.md with only the header and a note: "All deliverables validated automatically. No manual tests needed."

---

### Auto-validate test checklist

After generating test-checklist.md, attempt to automatically execute as many tests as possible. This reduces the human review burden and surfaces failures early.

#### 1. Classify each test

For each entry T1, T2, ... in test-checklist.md, inspect its `steps:` field and classify:

| Type | Classification criteria |
|---|---|
| `browser` | Steps mention URLs (http/https), "open", "navigate", "page", "screen", "click", "form", or UI element names |
| `cli` | Steps mention running commands, checking files, verifying output, reading logs |
| `manual` | Steps require human judgment: "verify the design feels right", "check accessibility", "confirm the copy reads well" |

#### 2. Execute browser tests

For each `browser` test, use Chrome automation tools:

```
mcp__claude-in-chrome__navigate → extract the target URL from the steps field
mcp__claude-in-chrome__get_page_text → extract page content
mcp__claude-in-chrome__find → locate elements expected by the test
```

Compare what is found against the test's `expected:` field. The test passes if the expected element or content is present; fails otherwise.

If Chrome automation tools are unavailable or raise an error, treat the test as `manual` (skip gracefully — do not block delivery).

#### 3. Execute CLI tests

For each `cli` test, run the command described in `steps:` using Bash with a **30-second timeout**:

```bash
timeout 30 <command from steps>
```

Compare the output against `expected:`. The test passes if output matches; fails if it does not or if the command times out.

#### 4. Skip manual tests

Leave `manual` tests with `result: [ ]` unchanged. They require human judgment and cannot be automated.

#### 5. Update test-checklist.md in place

After attempting auto-validation, rewrite only the `result:` and `notes:` fields for each test. Never modify `steps:` or `expected:`.

- **Test passed:** `result: [x]` + `notes: Auto-validated by delivery`
- **Test failed:** `result: [ ]` + `notes: Auto-validation failed: <reason>`
- **Test skipped (manual or tool unavailable):** `result: [ ]` + `notes: Requires human validation`

#### 6. Report auto-validation summary

After updating test-checklist.md, print:

```
## Auto-validation results
- T1: PASS (browser) — <what was verified>
- T2: PASS (cli) — <what was verified>
- T3: SKIPPED (manual) — requires human validation
- T4: FAIL (cli) — expected "200 OK", got "connection refused"

Auto-validated: N/M tests
Remaining for human: K tests
```

Track these numbers — `N` (passed), `M` (total), `K` (remaining for human) — for the final report.

#### Important rules

- Auto-validation is **best-effort**. A failed auto-validation does NOT block delivery.
- Auto-validated results (pass or fail) still appear in the review checklist. The human can override any result.
- CLI tests must have a 30-second timeout — do not let a hanging command stall delivery.
- Never modify `steps:` or `expected:` fields.

---

### Persist results

After all batches complete and before generating the final report, write `results.md` to the node directory:

```bash
${NODE_DIR}/results.md
```

Use Schema 5 format (see `templates/schemas.md`). For each deliverable, write one block with the fields: `task`, `status`, `summary`, `files_changed`, `errors`, `validation_result`. Blocks are separated by blank lines.

Include ALL deliverables — even skipped ones in amendment mode. For deliverables that were skipped, write:

```
task: D<N>
status: skipped
summary: Previously passing
files_changed:
errors:
validation_result:
```

Then generate `test-checklist.md` (see "Generate test-checklist.md" section above).

---

## Standards auto-update

After persisting results.md and test-checklist.md, check if the delivery introduced new standard-bearing files.

```bash
STANDARDS_SCRIPT="$REPO_ROOT/scripts/generate-standards.sh"

# Detect changed files matching standard-bearing patterns
CHANGED_STANDARDS=$(git diff origin/$MAIN_BRANCH...HEAD --name-only 2>/dev/null | grep -E \
  '(\.eslintrc|eslint\.config|\.stylelintrc|\.prettierrc|biome\.json|\
\.github/workflows/|\.github/actions/|Makefile|jest\.config|vitest\.config|\
pytest\.ini|\.mocharc|\.nvmrc|\.tool-versions|package\.json|pyproject\.toml|\
husky|lint-staged|commitlint|lefthook|\.editorconfig|tsconfig|jsconfig)' \
  | head -1)

if [ -n "$CHANGED_STANDARDS" ] && [ -f "$STANDARDS_SCRIPT" ]; then
  echo "Standards-bearing files detected — regenerating .claude/standards.md"
  bash "$STANDARDS_SCRIPT"
  # Commit updated standards.md if it changed
  if ! git diff --quiet "$REPO_ROOT/.claude/standards.md" 2>/dev/null; then
    git add "$REPO_ROOT/.claude/standards.md"
    git commit -m "chore: update standards.md after delivery

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
    echo "Standards: updated and committed."
  else
    echo "Standards: regenerated, no changes detected."
  fi
else
  # No new patterns or script not found — skip silently
  true
fi
```

---

## Final report

```
## Delivery complete — <feature name>

Deliverables:
- D1 — <title>: success
- D2 — <title>: success
- D3 — <title>: success

Build: passed
Tests: X/Y passed

Test checklist: <N> tests saved to <node-dir>/test-checklist.md
Auto-validated: <X>/<N> tests passed, <K> remaining for human

Next step: /fractal:review <path to node directory>
```

If there are unresolved failures:
```
Deliverables with issues:
- D3 — <title>: failed after 2 attempts
  Root cause: <diagnosis>
  Suggested next step: <action>
```

If amendment mode was active, the final report should note:
```
## Delivery complete (amendment) — <feature name>

Re-executed deliverables:
- D2 — <title>: success
- D4 — <title>: success

Skipped (from previous delivery):
- D1 — <title>: previously passing
- D3 — <title>: previously passing

Build: passed
Tests: X/Y passed

Next step: /fractal:review <path to node directory>
```

In amendment mode, skipped deliverables must also be written to results.md with `status: skipped` and `summary: Previously passing`. This ensures results.md is always a complete record of all deliverables regardless of amendment mode.

After successful amendment delivery, **delete review.md** to clear the amendment flag:
```bash
rm "${NODE_DIR}/review.md"
```
This prevents the next `/fractal:review` from seeing stale findings.

---

## Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Plan is the contract | Execute faithfully. Don't add deliverables not in the plan. |
| Parse the DAG | Read execution order from `## Execution DAG`, don't re-derive it. |
| Baseline must pass | Never start on a broken codebase. |
| Gates are opt-in | Only pause at explicit `gate: true` in the DAG. No implicit gates, not even after D1. |
| 2 retries max per deliverable | After 2 failures: stop and report. Don't fix indefinitely. |
| Subagents don't spawn subagents | All orchestration from this thread. |
| Sonnet by default | Never use opus in a subagent without explicit justification in the plan. |
| Structured results | Expect and parse the result schema. Proceed on narrative but note it. |
| Worktree for parallel writes | If two deliverables run in the same batch and modify files, use worktree isolation. |
| Commit per deliverable | Stage only files_changed — never git add -A. Commit immediately after integration. |
| Feature branch isolation | Create feat/<node-slug> before execution. Never commit to main branch during delivery. |

---

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Fix |
|---|---|
| Re-deriving execution order from descriptions | Parse the Execution DAG section |
| Launching all sequentially when parallelism is possible | If no shared files: launch in parallel |
| Continuing after 2 failures | Stop and report with full diagnosis |
| Subagent spawning subagent | Not possible — all launches from this thread |
| Ignoring structured result format | Parse task_id, status, errors — don't read as narrative |
| Skipping baseline check | Always verify build + tests before starting |
| Enriching prompt with session context | Only use runtime context block — no session state |
| Leaving changes uncommitted after integration | Commit per deliverable using files_changed from structured result |
| Committing directly to main/master | Create feature branch on entry — all commits go to feat/<node-slug> |

---

## When NOT to use

- No plan.md exists → run `/fractal:planning` first
- Plan not approved by human → get approval first
- Code already implemented and reviewed → run `/fractal:ship`
- Quick fix that doesn't need orchestration → do it directly
