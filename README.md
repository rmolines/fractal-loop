# Fractal

Recursive project management for Claude Code.

You tell it what you want. It figures out how to get there.

Most AI coding tools wait for instructions. You say "build this feature," they build
it. You say "fix this bug," they fix it. The thinking is on you. You decide what to
work on, in what order, and hope you're not wasting time on the wrong thing.

Fractal works differently. You state an objective. The agent figures out what
the biggest risk is, goes after that first, and keeps adjusting as it learns. It
doesn't follow a plan. At each step it asks: "what could I figure out right now
that would most change what we do next?"

It's a Claude Code plugin. Works on any project.

## How

You give it a goal. It turns that into a verifiable condition, breaks it down one
piece at a time, and always picks the piece that reduces the most uncertainty.

```
$ /fractal:init I want to build an open-source Granola — local meeting
  recorder that transcribes and feeds context into Claude Code via MCP

> Before I write the root predicate: are you capturing system audio
> (the call), microphone (your voice), or both?

Both. I want the full conversation, locally, no cloud.

> Predicate: "Users run a local MCP server that captures meeting audio,
> transcribes it, and exposes structured notes to Claude Code —
> no data leaves the machine."
> Create the tree?

Yes.

> Biggest risk: whether macOS even allows capturing system audio
> programmatically without a kernel extension. If it doesn't, the
> entire approach changes. Starting with a spike on ScreenCaptureKit.
```

A few days later:

```
$ /fractal:run

> Reading tree... 8 nodes. 3 satisfied, 5 pending.
> "screencapturekit-spike" satisfied — system audio capture works
> without kernel extension on macOS 13+.
> Re-evaluating parent... next risk: chunking live audio into
> segments the transcription model can handle. Starting there.
```

Session dies, you come back, run `/fractal:run`. It reads the filesystem
and picks up where it left off. When a piece is done, the parent gets
re-evaluated — maybe it needs another piece, maybe the whole direction
was wrong and it prunes the branch and tries something else.

## Install

Requires [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) with plugin support.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmolines/fractal/master/install.sh | bash
```

Start a new session and run `/fractal:run` in any repo. Override the install path
with `INSTALL_DIR=~/your/path` before the curl command.

## How is this different?

Other tools ask you to decompose upfront. You write a PRD, it becomes a task
list, the agent follows the list. If a task turns out wrong, you fix the list.

Fractal doesn't need a list. You state the goal, it picks the riskiest piece,
works on it, then reassesses. If a path doesn't work out, it backs up and tries
another.

**vs. [Task Master](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master) (~27k stars):**
PRD becomes a flat task list. No re-evaluation after each task.

**vs. [BMAD Method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD):**
Specialized agents per phase (PM, Architect, Developer). Rich but rigid — six
phases in fixed order.

**vs. [CCPM](https://github.com/automazeio/ccpm):**
GitHub Issues + worktrees. Sound state management but fixed hierarchy. Doesn't
handle plan invalidation.

**vs. native Claude Code Tasks:**
Good for checklists. Not for goal decomposition.

**What fractal does differently:**
- Conditions, not tasks. "Users can authenticate with Google" vs. "implement auth."
- One recursive primitive at every scale. No fixed hierarchy.
- One child at a time. Re-evaluate the parent after each.
- Pruning is a feature. Failed path → back up → try another.
- The tree is the plan, the log, and the state. Nothing else to maintain.

## The operation

One recursive function. Same structure at every scale.

```
fractal(predicate):
  discover(predicate)        → branch | leaf | unachievable
  if unachievable            → prune
  if leaf, patch can satisfy → patch → human validates
  if leaf, cycle needed      → prd → plan → build → review → ship → human validates
  if branch                  → find riskiest child → human validates → recurse
```

## This is fractal's own tree

The project manages itself with the same primitive it gives you.

20 of 71 nodes · 34 satisfied · 36 pending · 1 pruned
```

The pruned node (`return-to-parent`) was an approach that didn't work. The system
recognized it, backed up, and tried something else. That's the point.

Each satisfied node writes a `conclusion.md` — what was achieved, key decisions,
deferred items. Any future session reads conclusions instead of loading every
file. The tree is its own documentation.

## What it actually does

**Risk-first ordering.** The evaluator scores each candidate by uncertainty,
impact, and return. Highest uncertainty gets worked first — kill the unknown
before optimizing value delivery.

**Session continuity.** Die mid-sprint, come back next week. `/fractal:run`
reads the filesystem and picks up where you left off. No global pointer to fight
over.

**Parallel sessions.** Session locks prevent two sessions from working the same
node. Run multiple Claude Code sessions on the same project safely.

**Fast path.** `/fractal:patch` handles small changes without the full sprint
cycle. Only the final validation is human.

**Bottom-up capture.** `/fractal:propose` takes a raw idea, reframes it into a
verifiable condition, and places it in the tree.

**Engineering standards.** `/fractal:init` generates `.claude/standards.md` from
your codebase. Each delivery auto-updates it so standards never drift.

## Skills

**You use:**
- `/fractal:init` — state an objective, create the tree.
- `/fractal:run` — advance one step. Call repeatedly to converge on the goal.
- `/fractal:propose` — capture a raw idea, reframe it, place it in the tree.
- `/fractal:view` — open the HTML dashboard in your browser.

**Runs internally:**
- `/fractal:patch` — fast path for small changes.
- `/fractal:planning` → `/fractal:delivery` → `/fractal:review` → `/fractal:ship` — the sprint cycle.
- `/fractal:doctor` — tree integrity validation.
